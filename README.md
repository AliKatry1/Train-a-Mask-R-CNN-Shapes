# Train a Mask R-CNN on Synthetic Shapes

This project demonstrates how to train a Mask R-CNN model on a synthetic dataset containing simple geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles). It is based on the Matterport implementation of Mask R-CNN.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Understand the training pipeline for Mask R-CNN
- Experiment with synthetic data generation
- Visualize detection and segmentation results
